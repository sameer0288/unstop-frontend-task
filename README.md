## Notes

- All components are pixel perfect in design, except a few minor unnoticible places.
- Adding a new assessment updates state and shows the assessment in the list.
- Assessments are stored in localStorage, which will be replaced by a backend database in a real world app.
- User based sidebar option (Admin Round Status) has been implemented assuming Admin user. Can be disabled by changing user to anyone else.
- Simple hover states have been added to tabs/links to improve UX.
- Most transitions as shown in the Figma prototype have been implemented.
